# CPP-Design-Patterns-Explained

A collection of C++ design pattern implementations with practical examples.

## Patterns Implemented

### 01. Adapter Pattern (for legacy class)

Demonstrates the Adapter pattern using a frequency range example. Shows how to adapt incompatible legacy interfaces to work together through a common interface (`IFrequencyRange`).

## Building

```bash
cd 01_adapter
c++ -std=c++23 *.cpp
./a.out
```

## Requirements

- C++23 or later
